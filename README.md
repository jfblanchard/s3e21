Predictions on Dissolved O2, given O2, NO2, NO3, NH4, and BOD5

## Data
This dataset has data of the 5 indicators of river water content from 8 consecutive monitoring stations. The numbering of stations in the dataset is done from the target station upstream, ie closest to it - first, upstream - second, etc.

Indicators in this dataset are:

    *Dissolved oxygen (O2) is measured in mgO2/cub. dm (ie milligrams of oxygen (O2) in the cubic decimeter);

    *Ammonium ions (NH4) concentration is measured in mg/cub. dm (ie milligrams in the cubic decimeter);

    *Nitrite ions (NO2) concentration is measured in mg/cub. dm (ie milligrams in the cubic decimeter);

    *Nitrate ions (NO3) concentration is measured in mg/cub. dm (ie milligrams in the cubic decimeter);

    *Biochemical oxygen demand, which is determined in 5 days ("BOD5" or "BOD"). BOD5 is measured in mgO/cub. dm (ie milligrams of oxygen in the cubic decimeter).

Data are average monthly.
